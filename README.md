# Social Distancing
I created a mock pandemic. The agents follow one of three strategies based upon their role variable. Family's will have a call to cohesion to gather together with other agents. Although, this may not seem like a strong strategy for avoiding other agents it has a hidden benefit in that once a family has stuck togther the cohesion will make 'family' agents move slower towards an event. Loner agents will have a call to separate from all other agents. Reckless agents will aimlessly wander the canvas. Clicking the mouse will create an event at the mouse's location which all agents will seek. 

My system starts with one sick agent of a random role. That agent will likely go on to infect other agents. There is no form of recovery in my system, so there is a strong likelihood all of the agents will eventually be infected.
